Test 2

We'd like to see a grid placed in the div, generated from the data in the string, 

displaying only those records with an account

number beginning with ‘B’, and sorted by account number.
   
Please format numeric values in the form 0.00 and date values as 11 January 2017. 

Items in the Value field with a value of less than 100 should have a red background, 

items with a Value field greater than 500  should have a green background.

Feel free to use any online tools and javascript frameworks you like. 
As a guide we suggest not spending more than an hour
on this task.
